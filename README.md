# YouTube Downloder
I created a user-friendly app that helps you to download any YouTube video with python. In the next versions, you will be able to download the whole playlist if you want. You need to copy and paste the URL, and in a few seconds, the app downloads the video in your specified folder.

You can use this application instead of that 500mb significant software, and it's also enough user friendly.

The app is available on both Windows and Mac OS.
To get the app, please send me an email; I will provide you with the link to download and use it.

Moreover, please feel free to give us your feedback to share your experience.
